# Image-and-Video-Processing
Tasks
1. Prewitt edge detector: gradient filter Ã©s nonmaxima-suppression (NMS)
Output is two images: 1. gradient magnitute; 2. final result after NMS.

2. Thresholding algorithm by Otsu
Output: thresholded image and obtained threshold value.

3. Detection of circular object by edge detection and Hough transform for circles
Input: 1. image containing circular objects, 2. range of diameters. Output: 1. accumulator image; 2. input image with objects detected in given range of diameters.

4. Motion tracking of feature points and dense optical flow
Input: 1. short video sequence; 2. maximum displacement.
Output: 1. points tracked in the video sequence; 2. optical flow of the sequence.
